Our system, enchanted scissors, is a digitally controlled pair of scissors (Figure 1).

Therefore, unlike a completely digitalized cutting device, the user can freely apply improvisations within the permitted areas in real-time. A pair of scissors is a common tool seen and used in everyday life; the user can instantly recognize its operation method. It has varieties of usage from opening a letter to creating a complicated paper craft.

Recent interactive fabrication tools reintroduce this directness, but at the expense of precision. In this paper, we introduce constructable, an interactive drafting table that produces precise physical output in every step. Users interact by drafting directly on the workpiece using a hand-held laser pointer. The system tracks the pointer, beautifies its path, and implements its effect by cutting the workpiece using a fast high-powered laser cutter. Constructable achieves precision through tool-specific constraints, user-defined sketch lines, and by using the laser cutter itself for all visual feedback, rather than using a screen or projection. We demonstrate how constructable allows creating simple but functional devices, including a simple gearbox, that cannot be created with traditional interactive fabrication tools.},

In this paper, we address this issue and present a novel tabletop-based tangible editor, called NatCut, that allows the quick and easy design of physical enclosures for interactive prototypes. To generate an enclosure with NatCut, the user first chooses a basic geometric shape for it on the tabletop surface. By simply placing electronic components on the displayed 2D layout for the enclosure, respective cut-outs and holes are generated. Further, a number of user interactions on the tabletop screen are supported to modify, personalize, and enrich the casing. The resulting 2D layout contains all joints needed to assemble the parts after laser cutting. We discuss the results of a user study in which we tested the approach.},

In this paper, we examine skin as an interactive input surface for gestural 3D modeling-to-fabrication systems. When used as both the input surface and base canvas for digital design, skin-input can enable non-experts users to intuitively create precise forms around highly complex physical contexts: our own bodies. In this paper, we outline design considerations when creating interfaces for such systems. We then discuss interaction techniques for three different modes of skin-centric modeling: direct, parametric, and generative. We also present Tactum, a new fabrication-aware design system that captures a user's skin-centric gestures for 3D modeling directly on the body. Lastly, we show sample artifacts generated with our system, and share a set of observations from design professionals.},

We expand the design space involving hybrid (physical-digital) fabrication by describing how our system draws from art to support critical and reflective modes of making. In interaction with our system, participants distributed control between human and machine actors to support their preferred mode of making. These patterns reveal new opportunities and challenges for future hybrid fabrication systems, and suggest that designing for qualities of experience, like meditation and reflection, could support meaningful making experiences for many different kinds of makers.},

After defining a shape to extrude, the users follow the lead of a hand-held actuated extruder to instantiate the actual extrusion using wax. The tangibility of the wax extrusion sets the stage to create the next components until the digital model is completed. The digital model affords all digital attributes (ease of transformation, distribution, and 3D printing) while the wax artifact can be discarded or kept as a one-of-a-kind memento. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of D-Coil and showcase how this additive approach can also be extended to a subtractive process using a digitally actuated cutter. By adding a 6DOF mouse, users can also include scaling, rotation, and bending effects to create a wide variety of shapes often difficult for novices to produce in standard CAD software.},

We explore how the introduction of new computational and industrial machine objects (here, Computer Numerical Controllers) remediates traditional relations of craft and the forms of human-object value, care, and creativity built around them. We also chart new forms of creative practice and material flow that emerge from this encounter, and show how remediations of craft in the Castle studio may pose questions and opportunities for wider CSCW concerns around craft, creativity, and design.},

Motivated by the notion of digital technology as a material for interaction design, this research aims to develop a theoretical foundation to create and critique digital artifacts in the context of interaction design and HCI research. Specifically we conceptualize digital form and materiality as two reciprocal aspects of digital artifact based on the perspectives from relevant disciplines including design, arts, craft, material culture and philosophy of technology. The conceptualization emphasizes the process of making, personal meanings, and socio-cultural values of digital artifacts, constructing a new theoretical framework for exploratory and critical research approaches. In the end we discuss a proposal for form-driven interaction design research as a new approach to HCI with its focus on form and materiality aspects of digital artifacts based on the reflection on our theoretical propositions.},

To do this, we first examine conceptual dimensions of form in interactive artifacts through the lens of three existing perspectives with their respective focus on: material, meaning, and making. We then apply these perspectives in our analysis of specific forms of interactive artifacts. Based on this analysis, we suggest a model of four different types of forms: the cognitive, embodied, expressive, and exploratory forms.

In a 2x2 between-participants Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with (N=68) high-school students we specifically examined how this prototyping agent's expression of interest affected perceptions of the agent and learning outcomes dependent on the embodiment of the agent as embedded in the prototyping material itself or as an external entity.

In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds. The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design.},

Central to this argument is physical interactivity as a defining feature of new media in addition to the psychological interaction with a work as Lev Manovich [27] describes. It is also argued that interactivity will always remain opposed to traditional narrative forms, but that a similar engagement and willing suspension of disbelief are equally important within interactive works if explored on interactivity's own terms, especially through an understanding of play.The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi [12, 13] has written extensively on the intrinsic pleasures of creative action and argues that activities can be rewarding in and of themselves, regardless of any goals or outcomes. Csikszentmihalyi describes this theory of the autotelic experience as the flow principle and it relates directly to the engagement with interactive experiences. Case studies are cited in which the flow principle can be applied to interactivity and shows that engagement may begin and end with playful experiences that are satisfying in their own right.},

We expand the design space involving hybrid (physical-digital) fabrication by describing how our system draws from art to support critical and reflective modes of making. In interaction with our system, participants distributed control between human and machine actors to support their preferred mode of making. These patterns reveal new opportunities and challenges for future hybrid fabrication systems, and suggest that designing for qualities of experience, like meditation and reflection, could support meaningful making experiences for many different kinds of makers.},

After defining a shape to extrude, the users follow the lead of a hand-held actuated extruder to instantiate the actual extrusion using wax. The tangibility of the wax extrusion sets the stage to create the next components until the digital model is completed. The digital model affords all digital attributes (ease of transformation, distribution, and 3D printing) while the wax artifact can be discarded or kept as a one-of-a-kind memento. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of D-Coil and showcase how this additive approach can also be extended to a subtractive process using a digitally actuated cutter. By adding a 6DOF mouse, users can also include scaling, rotation, and bending effects to create a wide variety of shapes often difficult for novices to produce in standard CAD software.},

We explore how the introduction of new computational and industrial machine objects (here, Computer Numerical Controllers) remediates traditional relations of craft and the forms of human-object value, care, and creativity built around them. We also chart new forms of creative practice and material flow that emerge from this encounter, and show how remediations of craft in the Castle studio may pose questions and opportunities for wider CSCW concerns around craft, creativity, and design.},

Motivated by the notion of digital technology as a material for interaction design, this research aims to develop a theoretical foundation to create and critique digital artifacts in the context of interaction design and HCI research. Specifically we conceptualize digital form and materiality as two reciprocal aspects of digital artifact based on the perspectives from relevant disciplines including design, arts, craft, material culture and philosophy of technology. The conceptualization emphasizes the process of making, personal meanings, and socio-cultural values of digital artifacts, constructing a new theoretical framework for exploratory and critical research approaches. In the end we discuss a proposal for form-driven interaction design research as a new approach to HCI with its focus on form and materiality aspects of digital artifacts based on the reflection on our theoretical propositions.},

The objective of this paper is to conceptualize what we mean by form in the context of interaction design and HCI research and how we can approach it in regard to emerging type of digital materiality. To do this, we first examine conceptual dimensions of form in interactive artifacts through the lens of three existing perspectives with their respective focus on: material, meaning, and making. We then apply these perspectives in our analysis of specific forms of interactive artifacts. Based on this analysis, we suggest a model of four different types of forms: the cognitive, embodied, expressive, and exploratory forms. Reflecting on this model, we propose form-driven interaction design research with its epistemological and methodological implications.},

In a 2x2 between-participants Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with (N=68) high-school students we specifically examined how this prototyping agent's expression of interest affected perceptions of the agent and learning outcomes dependent on the embodiment of the agent as embedded in the prototyping material itself or as an external entity.

	abstract = {We draw on the concept of agency in order to understand the process of how design materials 'talk back' to designers. In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds. The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design.},

Devotion is performative, taking time, skill, and repetition to get the results that you want. Human-scale farming depends on the labor of people to get things done, relying on hand tools and particular kinesthetic actions to change the earth in a plot. Digital media technologies afford the creation of tools that can materialize rhetoric, creating alternate functionality emphasizing issues of practice through use. Creating gardening implements that build on the repetitive physical nature of gardening work allows handwork to become something broader: representative of, more reflexive and meditative technological practice. {\textbackslash}},

How can we explain and teach how criticality can be applied to design? How can we assess, compare and give context to critical designs? How should we understand the relationships among practices that bear affinities to critical design, such as speculative design or critical engineering? We argue that many of these issues would be clarified if the HCI and design research communities had a collection of examples that exemplified not just critical design in general, but also its major genres, styles, historical trends, rhetorics, and other distinctions. As a first step in this direction, we detail our efforts to develop a more systematic vocabulary to talk about critical design. After assembling a small operative corpus from a wider inventory of critical designs, we apply poststructuralist semiotic theory to propose a number of analytic distinctions and concepts that could be used-along with others like them-to more systematically and deliberately construct a canon of exemplars and a more mature conceptual vocabulary for critical design.},

In interaction with our system, participants distributed control between human and machine actors to support their preferred mode of making. These patterns reveal new opportunities and challenges for future hybrid fabrication systems, and suggest that designing for qualities of experience, like meditation and reflection, could support meaningful making experiences for many different kinds of makers.},

As makers ourselves, we see potential for collaborative making to mitigate barriers in communication and provide insight into non-digital practices and values. To evaluate this approach, we visited a hunter-gatherer community that preserves an ancient craft, bringing with us digital design and fabrication tools. Working together, we merged digital tools with ostrich eggshell jewelry craft. We use this experience to draw conclusions about making as a form of communication, the importance of supporting appropriation and immediacy in collaborations, the challenge of combining abstract design tools with concrete approaches, and the value of incorporating design and making into communal life.},

They use vector-graphics software to sketch models, laser-cutters to customize parts, and 3D printers to generate prototypes. However, how our experiences of expressivity, skill and value shift with these developments remains under-explored. This paper describes our early engagements with emerging fabrication technologies in the domain of ceramics, one of our oldest and most enduring artistic mediums. In particular, we detail a collaboration with Helen Martino that resulted in the Sound Bowl, a vessel designed to record an audio message through surface undulations, much like a vinyl record. As an example of design as inquiry, we developed the bowl to explore the integration of digital fabrication in ceramics production. In the process, we found new and intriguing tensions in the entanglement of code and clay: contrasting temporal frames, blurred traces of breakage, and coinciding human senses. We discuss implications of these observations on the nature and organization of embodied interaction.},

We use a projector/camera pair to scan a work in progress, and project multiple forms of guidance onto the object itself that indicate which areas need more material, which need less, and where any ridges, valleys or depth discontinuities are. The user adjusts the model using the guidance and iterates, making the shape of the physical object approach that of the target 3D model over time. We show how this approach can be used to create a duplicate of an existing object, by scanning the object and using that scan as the target shape. The user is free to make the reproduction at a different scale and out of different materials: we turn a toy car into cake. We extend the technique to support replicating a sequence of models to create stop-motion video. We demonstrate an end-to-end system in which real-world performance capture data is retargeted to claymation. Our approach allows users to easily and accurately create complex shapes, and naturally supports a large range of materials and model sizes.},

Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite {PCFGs}, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.},

As digital systems and information become meaningfully parts of people's everyday and social relationships, it is essential to develop new insights about how technology intersects with legacy and inheritance practices. We designed three interactive systems to investigate how digital materials might be passed down in the future. We conducted in-home interviews with ten parents using the systems to provoke discussion about how technology might support or complicate their existing practices. Sessions revealed parents desired to treat their digital information in ways not fully supported by technology. Findings are interpreted to describe design considerations for future work in this emerging space.},

Analysis of user comments suggests that the metaphor of a {\textbackslash}'1c"limited digital edition"{\textbackslash}'1d raises issues and to some extent is resisted. The second approach is the Flickr Brushes Gallery, where digital painters post images and comment on one another's work. Analysis of comment boards indicates that the shared art and comments are a form of gift exchange. Finally, the paper discusses a field study in which artists exhibited their work as it develops over time in digital frames and also in an immersive digital projection room. Analysis of field notes and interviews indicate that the digital frame approach was unsuccessful because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. The immersive projection suggested that more experiential approaches may be more interesting. It is argued that there is an inherent resistance in digital media to previous models of art commoditization. None of the approaches discussed here resolve the dilemma but rather indicate the scope and complexity of the issues.},

A formalism for the complete, generative specification of a class of non-representational, geometric paintings or sculptures is defined, which has shape grammars as its primary structural component. Paintings are material representations of two-dimensional shapes generated by shape grammars, sculptures of three-dimensional shapes. Implications for aesthetics and design theory in the visual arts are discussed. Aesthetics is considered in terms of specificational simplicity and visual complexity. In design based on generative specifications, the artist chooses structural and material relationships and then determines algorithmically the resulting art objects. We present a formalism for the complete specification of families of nonrepresentational, geometric paintings and sculptures. Formally defining the specification of an art object independently of the object itself provides a framework in which theories of design and aesthetics can be developed. The specifications},

As our attention for visual impulses and cognitive effort has become more competitive, new approaches are being pursued to convey information to people in memorable and intuitive ways. With human's inherent proficiency in comprehending the physical affordances present in the real world, some researchers and designers are investigating how meaningful insights can be conveyed by way of "sculpting" data. This paper proposes a domain model to establish the concept of data sculpture as a data-based physical artifact, possessing both artistic and functional qualities, that aims to augment a nearby audience's understanding of data insights and any socially relevant issues that underlie it. This paper also proposes a model of embodiment to capture and analyze the wide and multi-layered spectrum of existing data sculptures. In this model, the introduced concepts of metaphorical distances are used as a means to measure embodiment in data sculpture. The models provide groundwork for useful design principles for effective information communication of socially relevant, data-driven insights to a large, lay audience using data sculpture.},

	abstract = {Research in sustainable {HCI} has repeatedly pointed to the need for encouraging longer use of technology as part of the solution for stemming the tide of e-waste. Ways of achieving this goal remain elusive, however. We build upon previous research that considers the role of personal attachment in object ownership, and how this attachment might be leveraged to encourage longer use. We conducted a personal inventories study with 17 households in Switzerland, and use the findings to support and expand Odom et al.'s framework of attachment categories. We subsequently provided this framework to 3 designers and asked them to design novel technologies that encourage attachment. This exercise shed light on how they drew insight and inspiration from the framework, and how they integrated it into their design processes and design thinking.},
